/**
 * Tests don't have access to the requestionAnimationFrame API, so this function
 * provides a mock for it. It holds on to all queued calls, and the returned function
 * will flush and execute all of the calls in the order they were received.
 *
 * It uses jest.spyOn, which will automatically clear itself after the test is run.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *    const flushRafCalls = mockRaf();
 *    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
 *      // Do something
 *    });
 *    flushRafCalls();
 *
 * By default this will also repeatedly call requests chained during the
 * callback, but only 5 times at most, and will throw after that. If you want to
 * call the callbacks only once, you can pass { once: true } to flushRafCalls:
 *
 *    flushRafCalls({ once: true })
 *
 * Normally timestamps are passed to the callbacks. By default this mock doesn't
 * do that, but you can pass the timestamps to use with the "timestamps"
 * parameter:
 *
 *    flushRafCalls({ timestamps: [10000, 10100] });
 *
